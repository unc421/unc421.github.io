          <a> Extraction, Assimilation, and Accommodation: The Historical Foundations of Indigenous-State Relations in Latin America.

</summary>
         <p><font size="2"> Why do some indigenous communities experience assimilation while others obtain government protection for their longstanding institutions and cultures? I argue that historical experiences with labor extraction play a key role. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Latin American governments enacted discriminatory policies that conscripted unpaid indigenous labor to build roads and railways. Communities exposed to this extraction faced a common enemy, increasing collective action capacity within and across communities. Over time, this ability to collectively mobilize endured and enabled native groups to obtain more substantial government protections for their institutions and cultures. I test this argument using an original natural experiment in which communities’ exposure to unpaid labor conscription on a 1920s Peruvian highway was as-if randomly assigned. I combine this design with historical data on indigenous rebellions and community-level collective action, as well as contemporary data on community conflict with outsiders, language survival, and the persistence of indigenous institutions. The theory and evidence shed new light on the long-term effects of discriminatory policies on indigenous groups’ political power.

</summary>
        <p><font size="2">Why do some indigenous groups achieve coethnic political representation while others
do not? In this paper, I highlight the primary role of communal property in shaping indigenous representation. While scholars often laud the developmental benefits
of communal land titling, I argue that formalizing collectively held land can inhibit
indigenous coordination to achieve political representation. Where communal land is
informally held, indigenous groups are more likely to invest in traditional institutions
that facilitate collective action to elect coethnic candidates to political office. Conversely, titling communal property secures indigenous land access but in the process
erodes traditional institutions that would otherwise promote collective action during
elections. I test my argument using a multi-method approach that includes interviews
and experiments with three-hundred Peruvian indigenous leaders, historical land-title
data, and information scraped from mayoral candidate CVs. The findings suggest that
the oft-cited economic benefits of collective property may generate negative political
effects.

       The Uneven Reach of Schools: Ethnicity and Education Provision in Nineteenth-Century Latin America.
          <details> <summary>
<a class="btnfire small stroke"><em class="fas fa-chevron-circle-down"></em>&nbsp;&nbsp; Abstract</a>    
</summary>
     <p><font size="2">   A well-established political economy literature predicts a positive relationship between ethnic homogeneity and public goods provision. Yet, the initial phase of education provision in nineteenth-century Latin America benefited ethnically heterogeneous, rather than homogeneous, areas. This article explores this unexpected finding, highlighting the central role of longstanding norms around regressive, ethnic-based taxation, which redistributed wealth from marginalized indigenous groups to a non-indigenous political and economic elite. Employing case studies, archival data, and a natural experiment from Peru, I show that non-indigenous political elites provided education most broadly in heterogeneous areas in which there existed both a coethnic demand for education <i> and</i> a large indigenous tax base that could be exploited to meet this demand. By contrast, in homogeneous indigenous areas, the non-indigenous elite did not expand education beyond their very narrow base of co-ethnics, resulting in an overall limited provision of primary schools. Finally, in homogeneous non-indigenous areas, where there existed no indigenous tax base, the political elite was reluctant to violate longstanding norms by levying taxes on coethnic white and <i>mestizo</i> citizens. Only under conditions of intra-elite competition did these politicians incur the norms-violating cost of taxing coethnics and thereby, expand primary education. This early and unequal expansion of primary education had long-term implications for interethnic inequality in the region.

              Party System Erosion: Evidence from Peru.</a>

       <p><font size="2">Weakly institutionalized party systems are a defining feature of third-wave democracies. Yet, in some countries, like Peru, party weakness is not a static equilibrium but rather part of a 
          dynamic process of “party system erosion” in which weak parties become weaker over time as independents 
          come to dominate subnational posts. As I argue, party system erosion is driven by a particular configuration 
          of institutional factors—weak party brands, low barriers to ballot access, and limited partisan control over 
          resource distribution during and after campaigns. These institutional features increase the likelihood that 
          experienced candidates will run as independents. When these candidates are elected, experience enables them to 
          obtain more intergovernmental discretionary transfers. The superior in-office performance of experienced, 
          independent officials further weakens party brands, leading fewer and fewer experienced candidates to run 
          with parties. I test this theory using a dataset of 80,000 subnational officials and a regression discontinuity design.

     <p><font size="2">As increasingly large shares of the developing world’s population come to live in cities, 
     it is important to examine the effects of political, fiscal, and administrative decentralization 
     on urban governance and service delivery. Relevant academic scholarship and policy research, we show, 
     suggests that clientelism, populism, and local capture often persist following the establishment of 
     municipal elections. However, conditions such as political competition, independent fiscal resources, 
     and strong civil societies can facilitate more democratic outcomes following decentralization. Meanwhile, 
     our review of literature on decentralization’s impact on two quintessentially “urban” services—land market 
     regulation and urban water and sanitation—suggests that decentralization involves important trade-offs.  
     On the one hand, decentralization can help citizens to pressure more effectively for inclusion and access, 
     particularly in the presence of political competition and a robust civil society.  On the other hand, 
     it can make it more difficult for policymakers to address metropolitan-level or long run concerns regarding investments 
     in basic infrastructure that are often not at the forefront of voters’ minds. We also highlight the need 
     for primary data collection, suggest research design strategies that would allow for more rigorous empirical 
       analyses, and highlight important topics that have received very little attention. </font></p>

         Does Information Lead to Implementation? Field Experimental Evidence from Peru. (Research design)

    <p><font size="2"> A growing literature in political science and economics has addressed how the provision of
information to citizens shapes accountability, corruption, and voter turnout in the developing
world. Yet, only limited attention has been devoted to understanding the information
environments of local-level elected officials, particularly whether they have adequate and
accurate information about the effects of certain nationally funded programs and how different
types of information affect their decisions to implement those programs in their municipalities.
Two questions thus arise: 1) How do officials’ decisions to implement programs change once
they are correctly informed about various program effects? And 2) are local officials more
concerned with the policy outcomes of programs or their potential electoral effects? I use a field experiment with Peruvian 
          mayors to answer this question.

       <p><font size="2">      Instrumental-variables (IV) analysis bridges structural equation modeling and design-based methods for causal inference. In both frameworks, researchers invoke random or as-if random assignment of units to treatment conditions as a way of addressing concerns about confounding variables. Yet, despite areas of convergence, these different approaches to IV analysis rely on distinct underlying assumptions. In this chapter, we discuss areas of overlap and divergence in the modeling strategies. While structural equations embed several core assumptions in linear response schedules, design-based approaches disaggregate and clarify these assumptions. We then use a hypothetical empirical example—price elasticity of demand for coffee—to illustrate these similarities and differences.   The chapter concludes with a note of caution on the use of instrumental variables for political science and international relations: whichever framework is invoked, IV analysis generates results that may not generalize beyond the specific intervention that gave rise to the instrument.

            Disrupting Regulation, Regulating Disruption: The Politics of Uber in the United States</a>.

         <p><font size="2"> Platform companies disrupt not only the economic sectors they enter, but also the regulatory regimes that 
          govern those sectors. We examine Uber in the United States as a case of regulating this disruption in different 
          arenas: cities, state legislatures, and judicial venues. We find that the politics of Uber regulation does not 
          conform to existing models of regulation. We describe instead a pattern of disrupted regulation, characterized 
          by a consistent challenger-incumbent cleavage, in two steps. First, an existing regulatory regime is not deregulated 
          but successfully disregarded by a new entrant. Second, the politics of subsequently regulating the challenger leads to 
          a dual regulatory regime. In the case of Uber, disrupted regulation takes the form of challenger capture, an elite driven 
          pattern, in which the challenger has largely prevailed. It is further characterized by the surrogate representation of 
          dispersed actors—customers and drivers—who do not have autonomous power and who rely instead on alignment with the challenger 
          and incumbent. In its surrogate capacity in city and state regulation, Uber has frequently mobilized large numbers of customers 
          and drivers to lobby for policy outcomes that allow it to continue to provide service on terms it finds acceptable. Because 
          drivers have reaped less advantage from these alignments, labor issues have been taken up in judicial venues, again primarily 
          by surrogates (usually plaintiffs’ attorneys) but to date have not been successful. </font></p>

         <p><font size="2">The rise of labor platforms is a cause and consequence of an ongoing change in the nature of work toward a model where workers split time across multiple companies, without the rights and benefits of employment.  Given that Uber exercises more control over workers than most other labor platforms, it provides a most likely case for regulation. Nevertheless, regulators in legislative and judicial arenas failed to regulate labor on ride-hailing apps in the first six years. We explain this failure in terms of 1) the problem of classifying a new type of firm, and 2) the relative distribution of power between labor and capital. The weakness of the former emerges from collective action problems and has given rise to a form of skewed surrogate representation.  A handful of recent regulatory attempts introduces a note of uncertainty for the future.</font></p>
